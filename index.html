<h1>What are relevant to PM2.5 in Beijing</h1>
<h2>—— Temperatures? Wind Directions? Time? </h2>

<h3 style="color: teal">Introduction</h3>
<text>
    Air pollution has been a global concern for many years. As an important index of air pollution, PM2.5 (Particulates) is discussed in China for years.
    Even citizens who do not work on air pollutions field are interested at PM2.5 research.
    <b>The visualisation focuses on average PM2.5 in Beijing (Beijing Capital International Airport included) from 2010 to 2014.</b>
    The data set is taken from US Embassy in Beijing.<br><br>
    <b>This visualisation can help people who are interested at PM2.5' causation to</b>: <br><br>
    (1) explore relationships between <b>temperatures and annual average PM2.5</b>;<br>
    (2) compare <b>annual average PM2.5 from 2010 to 2014</b>;<br>
    (3) explore relationships between <b>wind directions and PM2.5 in a year</b>;<br>
    (4) compare<b> monthly average PM2.5 in a year</b>.<br>

<h3 style="color: teal">How to use the visualisation (Interactions)</h3>

<text>
    Click left -top "<b>Dataset</b> " button can view the UCI page which supplies the original data set.<br><br>
    Click left -top "<b>Enter</b>" button can view the visualisation.<br>
    The left line chart contains tendency of annual average PM2.5, temperatures, and atmospheric pressure from 2010 to 2014.<br>
    Click points on the line chart can mark them red. <br>
    The right bar chart shows average PM2.5 of each year.<br><br>

    After enter the visualisation, click right "<b>Enter XXXX</b>" (e.g. Enter 2010) button can see detailed PM2.5 information in the year.<br>
    The first four bars present average PM2.5 with different wind directions in this year;<br>
    The last twelve bars present monthly average PM2.5 in this year.<br><br>

    Roll over any bar can show a numeric value of PM2.5.<br><br>

    Click "<b>Reset</b>" button will reset the visualisation.<br><br>

<h3 style="color: teal">Description of Visual Variables</h3>
<text>
    There are mainly three part of the visualisation.
    When enter the visualisation:
    (1) The line chart on the left; (2) The bar chart on the right;
    When enter the detailed information in a year:
    (3) Two bar charts for wind direction - PM2.5 and month - PM2.5.<br><br>

    For (1), position is used to show values of PM2.5, temperatures, and pressures.
    Three colors are used to help distinguish three attributes.
    In case readers have difficulties to tell colors, annotations are used.

    Because air pollutions can be influenced by pressures to an extent,
    the stable pressure line here can give a reference to readers to exclude the potential variable.

    Because the point is to see whether temperatures and PM2.5 are relevant by their tendencies,
    temperatures are multiplied by 8. Similarly, pressures are multiplied by 10.
    <br><br>

    For (2), sizes and colors are used for comparison. Readers can see bars to have an intuitive feeling of PM2.5 values.
    Then, by putting a mouse on bars, people can see values of PM2.5. Green is for good air conditions, yellow is bad, while
    red means serious pollutions.<br><br>

    For (3), similar with (2), sizes and colors are used.
    To implement (3), only one array is used for both wind-PM2.5 and month-PM2.5 charts, which may violate some thoughts of programming.
    The reason is to avoid visual errors caused by different measuring scales. If both charts use different scales, confusions may
    occur (e.g. a bar for PM2.5 = 90 is longer than another bar for PM2.5 =95). Similarly, only one color is applied to all bars.

<h3 style="color: teal">Materials used for Implementation</h3>
<text>
    Basically, the visualisation is based on code of 5044 tutorials
    (especially linegraph.html, visualElements.html, and basicInteraction_final).
    To finish this visualisation, googled online materials about CSS, HTML basics (such as creating tables on a HTML page) are referred.
    In addition, lecture notes and <i>Tamara Munzner. Visualization Design and Analysis. 2015; Chapter 5: Marks and Channels</i> are referred.
<br><br>
</text>

<h3 style="color: teal">Insights from the visualisation & Critical discussion</h3>
<text>
    Recall questions mentioned before, insights can be:<br>
    (1) It seems temperatures are not very relevant to PM2.5, although from 2011 to 2013 both lines have similar tendencies.
    There may be other reasons affecting the PM2.5 in 2010 and 2014.<br>
    (2) It is easy to find in days with no combined wind or southeast wind, PM2.5 are higher. This can help people to
    detect other sources of air pollutions. For example, maybe the wind bring unhealthy air from southeast cities into Beijing.
    In days with no wind, PM2.5 are still high. This may because Beijing itself have heavy air pollution problems.<br>
    (3) In general, winters (Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb) have more serious air pollutions than other seasons. This may because the usage of
    coals increases in winters.<br><br>

    There are mainly two things the visualisation should improve:<br>
    (1) There is no enough comparisons about temperatures-PM2.5 relationships. Data points used are only five. However, it is not practical to
    display all 43,825 data points on a web page. To deal with this problem, an easy way is to calculate monthly sums of PM2.5.
    However, this will cause concerns on the distinguish of seasons and temperatures. For example, winters' high PM2.5 does not imply
    low temperatures will help PM2.5 increase. So, so far, the best way to deal with this problem is to collect PM2.5 information in more
    years.<br>
    (2) The relationship of wind-PM2.5 can be improved by maps. Although bar charts are more intuitive than maps, for one of purposes
    to do this part —— detect whether air pollutions in Beijing are caused by other cities to an extent, maps with cities' names can help readers
    to think about it. Readers can easily give a rough judgement by common senses about cities. For example, if a big industrial city
    is near to Beijing and the visualisation points out the wind from that direction has a higher PM2.5 values, readers can detect it.
